This repository contains a few meta-heuristic algorithms. They are useful if you do not need a globally optimal solution for your minimization problem, but can contend with a *good* solution. In general they are pretty fast, although that very much depends on the problem and the speed of evaluating the fitness of a candidate solution.

For more in-depth implementation information see [the documentation](https://jonathanbp.github.io/metaheuristics/MetaHeuristics.html).
